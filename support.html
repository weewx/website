      <h2>Support</h2>
      <p>
        In the world of open-source hobbyist software, WeeWX is pretty easy
        to install and configure. There are not many package dependencies,
        the configuration is simple, and it has an extensive User's Guide.
        There are thousands of people who have successfully done an
        install. However, there is no "point-and-click" interface, so
        you have to be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get in
        there.
      </p>
      <p>You should have the following skills:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The patience to read and follow the User's Guide;
        <li>Willingness and ability to edit a configuration file;</li>
        <li>Some familiarity with Linux or other Unix derivatives;</li>
        <li>Know how to do simple Unix tasks like changing file
          permissions and running commands;</li>
        <li>No programming experience is necessary unless you wish
          to extend WeeWX. In this case, you should have some
          familiarity with Python.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you get stuck, there is a very active User's Group to
        help, but please first try to solve the problem yourself.</p>


      <h2>Wiki</h2>
      <p>
        The wiki content is contributed by WeeWX
        users. It contains suggestions and experiences with different
        types of hardware, skins, extensions to WeeWX,
        and other useful tips and tricks summarized from the Forums.
