<h2>How to install</h2>
  <p>
    There are several ways to install WeeWX.  Follow the instructions for one
    of the <em>Installer</em> methods below.
  </p>
  <table id='install_methods'>
    <tr><th class='method'>Installer</th><th>Systems</th><th>Best for...</th></tr>
    <tr>
      <td class='method'><a href="/docs/quickstarts/debian.html">Debian</a></td>
      <td>Ubuntu, Mint, Raspberry Pi OS, Devuan</td>
      <td rowspan="3">This is the fastest and easiest way to get up and running. The Debian, Redhat, and SUSE package installers use <em>apt</em>, <em>yum</em>, and <em>zypper</em>, respectively. You will need root access to install and run.</td>

      <td class='method'><a href="/docs/quickstarts/pip.html">pip</a></td>
      <td>any operating system</td>
      <td>The pip installer will work on any operating system. Use this approach for macOS or one of the BSDs, or if you are using an older operating system. When used in a Python "virtual environment" (recommended), this approach is least likely to disturb other applications on your computer. This is also a good approach if you plan to do a lot of customization, or if you are developing a driver, skin, or other extension. Root access is not needed to install, but may be needed to run.</td>

      <td>any operating system</td>
      <td>If you want to install WeeWX on a system with very little storage, or if you want to experiment with code that is under development, then you may want to run directly from the WeeWX sources. Root access is not needed to install, but may be needed to run.</td>
